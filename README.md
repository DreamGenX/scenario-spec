# Scenario Spec

This is a specification for "scenarios" that represent a story-writing or role-playing context / environment.

- Plot description, writing style description, past events summary 
- Entities (characters, locations, items)

## Motivations

The scenario spec was created out of need to represent complex story-writing / role-play environments, featuring multiple characters and other entities.
It can be compared to the [Character Card specification](https://github.com/malfoyslastname/character-card-spec-v2).

## TODO:

- Representation of facts / lore suitable for RAG
- Better README :)
